### Abstract
<div class="abstract">
_This paper presents state-of-the-art, emerging technological advances in artistically driven, non-photorealistic 3D computer animation,  Additionally, a live, watercolor location-driven stylization
workflow of a 3D animated scene, in real-time, will also be showcased in which artist retains their vision, while the computer handles the repetition. This example demonstrates how artistically friendly and customizable these techniques and technologies can become. Finally, future applications, such as
stylized real-time interactive art and animation, will be discussed._
