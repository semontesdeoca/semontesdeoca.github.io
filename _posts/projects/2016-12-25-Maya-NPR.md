The _Maya Non-photorealistic Rendering Framework_ (**MNPR**) is a direct 3D stylization framework developed as part of my PhD research in _Real-time Watercolor Rendering of 3D Objects and Animation with Enhanced Control_. It partially contains and supports the technology found in:

* [Art-directed Watercolor Rendered Animation](../../articles/Art-directed-Watercolor-Rendered-Animation)
* [Art-directed Watercolor Stylization of 3D Animations in Real-time](../../articles/Art-directed-watercolor-stylization-of-3D-animations-in-real-time)
* [Edge- and substrate-based effects for watercolor stylization](../../articles/Edge-and-substrate-based-effects-for-watercolor-stylization/)
* [Direct 3D stylization pipelines](../../articles/Direct-3D-stylization-pipelines/)
* MNPR: A Framework for Real-Time Expressive Non-Photorealistic Rendering of 3D Computer Graphics (in press)

It proposes a direct stylization framework for _Expressive Rendering_, another common term for _Non-Photorealistic Rendering_ (NPR), directly in the _Maya_ viewport. This makes the system instantly familiar to artists accustomed to the software. The backend is developed using C++ and HLSL/GLSL, whereas the frontend is being handled through Python and MEL.Â 

The framework has been open-sourced under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and it can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/semontesdeoca/MNPR) and [NTU's data repository](https://doi.org/10.21979/N9/KU4B6S).
