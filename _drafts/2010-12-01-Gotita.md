gotita.

gotita. was my second short-film and the fist solo effort I did, as part of the Animation Seminar course at the School of Art, Design and Media of the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. As an exchange student, I challenged myself to tell a 30 second story to still be able to explore and enjoy South East Asia.
