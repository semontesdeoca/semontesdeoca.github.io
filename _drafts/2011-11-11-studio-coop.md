studio.coop

studio.coop was a startup created by Marcus LeVere and myself in 2012 to create an open cooperative production studio in the cloud, relying entirely on google apps as backend. While the endeavor was held due to financial constraints, new alternatives such as Artella are now available which follow our original purpose and philosophy. Our MVP platform can still be found under studio.coop.

I have recently reactivated the studio.coop Maya tools. A palette of animation tools for Maya under the Unlicense licensing philosophy which can be found here.
