Maya NPR System

The Maya NPR System is being developed as part of my PhD research in Real-time Watercolor Rendering of 3D Objects and Animation with Enhanced Control. It partially contains and supports the technology found in:
Art-directed Watercolor Rendered Animation
Direct Watercolor Stylization of 3D Animations in Real-time (in press)

It proposes a framework for Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR) directly in the Maya viewport, instantly familiar to artists accustomed to the software. The backend is developed using C++ and HLSL, whereas the frontend is being handled through Python and MEL. 

The system is free to use during its development stages (with watercolor stylization) and the source code will be openly available, upon graduation (approx. 2018). (See FAQ)

The Alpha-test is currently running and the Beta-test will begin by mid October. You can register for beta access through the following form.




FAQ
May I use the system for my own project/shortfilm?
Yes, I highly encourage you to contact me so that I can create a special version/build for you. 

May I have early access to the source code to develop a different kind of NPR using the system?
Yes, but under certain conditions. Please contact me, if interested.
