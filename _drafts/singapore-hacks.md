## Singaporean Life-hacks
Coming to Singapore from a foreign country can be daunting at the beginning. There are so many different systems and services in place that it usually is quite overwhelming.

This is a short guide of some life-hacks that I have been introduced to and frequently use, that has made my student life in Singapore easier and cheaper.


### Electronics

Electronics in Singapore are not cheap, that is why I usually use [amazon.com](http://smile.amazon.com/) as they deliver for free to Singapore (the oder must be of at least 125+ SGD) and it has sometimes unbeatable prices. However, its hard to keep track of these offers.

That's where [camelcamelcamel](http://camelcamelcamel.com) comes into play. Simply copy and paste the amazon URL into the camel search bar to get a detailed price chart. The chart shows price deviations over time and the website provides the ability to track the product price. This means that if the price in amazon reaches your desired price, you will get an email notification about it. Yeah, it's that awesome!

Just keep in mind that the maximum allowed into Singapore, without GST (7%) and in one shipment, is of 400 SGD. [[source]](https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/GST/Consumers/Consumers-Importing-Goods-into-Singapore/)

If you still want to check local retailers, you can view the price lists of Sim Lim Square [online](http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/priceLists) and decide for yourselves.

### Groceries

To buy groceries can be troublesome sometimes as it is almost impossible to afford a car in Singapore. However, if you are doing a big purchase for a party, you can always buy online at [redmart](https://redmart.com/) and let the groceries get to you. When using redmart, make sure to make your purchase through [shopback](https://www.shopback.sg/?raf=ISmbgF). This will allow you to get up to 10% in cashback for your purchase.


### Travel

Traveling from Singapore is awesome as there are many beautiful countries to visit nearby. You will probably be searching for places to stay in portals such as [booking.com](http://www.booking.com/), [agoda.com](http://www.booking.com/) and [hotels.com](https://sg.hotels.com/). What you may no know is that you can get cashback at all these places through [shopback](https://www.shopback.sg/?raf=ISmbgF).


### Books

Books are incredibly expensive in Singapore compared to other parts of the world. That is why I tend to also buy them online. I usually go for [usegoodbooks](https://gogoodbooks.com/). They are cheaper, have free delivery worldwide and the profits they make go to charity!


### Flea Market

There are a few flea markets in Singapore, though the digital age has made selling and buying a lot easier and convenient. One amazing example is [Carousell](https://carousell.com) in which you can find products for anything. I have used it for both selling and buying and it was great. You can also find massively discounted tickets to singaporean attractions like the Zoo and the recreation places in Sentosa.
